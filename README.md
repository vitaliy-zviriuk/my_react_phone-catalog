### Technologies were used:   

In this project, I developed a phone catalog using modern web development technologies:    

- **React**: Utilized React to build a dynamic and responsive user interface, allowing users to browse and filter phone   models efficiently.  
- **TypeScript**: Integrated TypeScript for type safety and improved code quality, enhancing the development experience with better tooling and error checking.  
- **React Router**: Implemented React Router to manage navigation within the application, enabling a seamless user experience with multiple views and dynamic URL routing.  
- **Context API**: Employed the Context API for state management, ensuring a predictable and consistent application state across different components.  
- **localStorage**: Utilized localStorage to persist user preferences and data, ensuring a seamless experience even after page reloads or browser restarts.  
- **Axios**: Used Axios for making HTTP requests to fetch data from an API, handling asynchronous operations and integrating backend services.  
- **HTML5**: Structured the website using semantic HTML5 elements to ensure accessibility and improve SEO performance.    
- **SCSS**: Styled the application using SCSS for modular and maintainable CSS, allowing for better organization and reuse of styles.  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the website is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and providing a consistent experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.  
-**Git**: Used Git for version control, tracking changes and collaborating effectively during the development process.
